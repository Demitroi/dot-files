#### Monitoring SSDs and HDDs

Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T., often written as SMART) is a monitoring system included in computer hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs).[2] Its primary function is to detect and report various indicators of drive reliability with the intent of anticipating imminent hardware failures.
